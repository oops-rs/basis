//! The process-scoped substrate every workspace borrows.
//!
//! ADR-0018's split. [`Workspace`](crate::Workspace) used to conflate two
//! lifetimes: half its configuration was process infrastructure — a privately
//! built mentra runtime, provider and credential resolution, the history store
//! policy, the host's interceptors — and half was repository discovery. A host
//! opening N workspaces paid the process costs N times. This module is the
//! noun the first half was missing.
//!
//! - **[`Runtime`]** owns mentra's runtime, the provider/credential/base-URL
//!   and model *policy*, the history store policy, and the host's
//!   interceptors. Build one with [`Runtime::builder`], share it with
//!   [`WorkspaceBuilder::with_runtime`](crate::WorkspaceBuilder::with_runtime).
//! - **[`Workspace`](crate::Workspace)** keeps what the repository says —
//!   context, skills, templates, hooks, `.mcp.json` — and borrows the runtime
//!   through an `Arc`. MCP *connections* stay workspace-owned: minted from
//!   repository config, dead with the workspace.
//! - **`Workspace::open(path)` is unchanged sugar** that builds a private
//!   default runtime bound to that path. The one-repository host never sees
//!   this module; only the N-repository host reaches for it.
//!
